## **Mango Leaf Disease Classification using MobileNetV2**
1. In this notebook, we implement an end-to-end deep learning solution for multi-class classification of mango leaf diseases using the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model. This project aims to assist farmers in accurately identifying diseases in mango leaves, enabling timely and effective treatment with appropriate pesticides.

By leveraging transfer learning with **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight yet powerful model architecture, we achieve high classification accuracy even with limited computational resources. The project covers every step of the model development pipeline, including data preprocessing, augmentation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation, resulting in a robust tool for disease detection in agricultural settings.

Project Highlights:

2. **Purpose:** To aid farmers in identifying mango leaf diseases for improved crop health and yield.

2. **Model:** MobileNetV2, known for its efficiency and suitability for deployment on mobile and edge devices.

3. **Goal:** High accuracy and lightweight deployment for practical use in real-world agricultural applications.

This notebook will walk through each stage of the project, from data preparation to model evaluation, offering a comprehensive approach to building an effective image classification model for disease detection.
